#Disaster Management Application (DMA)
The Disaster Management Application is a technology-driven solution designed to enhance communication, coordination, and resource management during disasters. The platform is structured into two key operational phases:

Personal description: this was my SIH 2024 idea to pitch. Worked further on this for my Software Engineering Course project.

Disaster Phase â€“ Focused on real-time support for rescuers and victims.
Post-Disaster Phase â€“ Facilitates external users in recovery, aid distribution, and analysis.
Key Features:
ðŸ”¹ Mesh Network Communication: Enables peer-to-peer communication in network-failure scenarios.
ðŸ”¹ People-to-People Connectivity: Prioritizes direct communication for emergency coordination.
ðŸ”¹ Geofencing Alerts: Sends real-time location-based alerts to affected areas.
ðŸ”¹ IVR (Interactive Voice Response) Technology: Provides automated voice-based assistance for non-smartphone users.
ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Data Sharing: Ensures critical updates and situational awareness.
ðŸ”¹ Privacy Protection: Secure and encrypted communication to safeguard user data.
ðŸ”¹ Funding Transparency Dashboard: Tracks and displays the allocation and utilization of disaster relief funds.

The DMA aims to streamline disaster response efforts, minimize communication breakdowns, and improve disaster resilience through technology and data-driven decision-making. If selected for the FAER Scholar Program, the project will undergo development over a 4-5 month timeline.
